## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have discovered a security issue, we ask that you report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

To assist us in understanding and addressing the issue effectively, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

Providing this information will help us review your message more quickly.
